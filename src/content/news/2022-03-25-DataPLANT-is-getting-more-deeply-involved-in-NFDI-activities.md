DataPLANT is getting more deeply involved in NFDI activities


With the completed onboarding of the second round of NFDI consortia the activities within the various bodies of the NFDI Association are
significantly on the rise. Activities are required in several fields starting from contributions to the four (later more) sections of the
NFDI, providing input to various topics like DSI/Nagoya or cooperation with other NFDI consortia.

The most relevant activity in the last couple of month was the contribution of input to the "Stellungnahme" and the follow-up kickoff
of the grant application of Base4NFDI (basic services for NFDI consortia). This resulted in a [Letter-of-Intent](tbd:DFGpublication) sent to the DFG on 21st
March where DataPLANT is in a participants role. Through these activities the DataPLANT community has the chance to further shape the
vision of the "OneNFDI" in exchange with the other consortia.

Beside the still ongoing base services application the NFDI sections require attention as they are part of the cross-domain topics. At the
moment four sections exist, which will get complemented by more in the future: 
[Common Infrastructures](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12xphbqLoScEvptg0wdCuUgMZmQSZYcbY);
[Section Metadata, Terminologies & Provenance](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1f9Q_4KV0uT1AWy_FPeYGfmejYLo4OLfu);
[Section Training and Education](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/194y6PfzSajacLpCHw1zLPO0Ueg6HGQl3?usp=sharing)
and [Section Ethical and Legal Aspects](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1g8KFurQTybBycSImxDng2ZJIkm3J853H?usp=sharing).

In Common Infrastructures the following initial set of working groups got created by now: Data Integration, Long Term Archival, Identity and
Access Management, Federated Multicloud, Research Software Engineering.


Cooperation and exchange should be fostered on different levels

Elixir Plants
DSI/Nagoya, experts are required
talks with the DFG on long-term sustainable financing options of the NFDI

interaction with the new head of the ministry of environment. The NFDI
needs to develop a proper understanding and do lobbying for the
interests of data producers and handlers with the relevant domains.


cooperation with other consortia

NFDI4BioImaging imaging data, ARC, OMERO, virtual desktop infrastructure
e.g. for training and education

NFDI-MatWerk ARC (description of material) and ontology service

The aim of DataPLANT's involvement in the NFDI association is twofold.
On the one hand, the ideas discussed in the individual rounds should be
used in DataPLANT, and on the other hand, the concepts, tools and
services developed in the consortium should be made available to the
general public through the work in the association.

Representatives in the association

DataPLANT is represented by Dr. Dirk von Suchodoletz, who also acts as
spokesperson for the DFG-funded consortium. Cristina Martins Rodrigues,
DataPLANT's project leader, was elected as deputy.

Allocation of activities

The Senior Management Board has decided to budget the efforts within the
association to 10-20% of the total capacity in DataPLANT, leaving 80-90%
to be used to advance the milestones within the consortium.

To handle the growing demand in expertise, coordination and exchange DataPLANT created a delegation model to ensure an efficient 
separation of efforts in fulfilling the objective described above. Individual persons are delegated to the respective boards and
committees of NFDI Association and the consortial assembly. If tasks are distributed, the delegated person is responsible for 
coordinating the execution of them. In addition, important points will be noted and made available to everyone in DataPLANT through
the Teams infrastructure (e.g. in the NFDI channel).
