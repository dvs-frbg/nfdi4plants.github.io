Join us for the NFDI-wide roadshow highlighting the basic services currently under development by Base4NFDI. This 
event offers an opportunity for NFDI participants and beyond to learn how these services will transform research 
within the NFDI framework and which potential implications it has for DataPLANT. 
[Registration](https://uni-goettingen.zoom.us/meeting/register/u5YldeChqz4rH9E-p3Jbx3VbKfpMlzighpsy#/registration)
is possible online from now on (it is an online event).

During the event there will be various presentations:  Various teams will showcase their services, explaining the 
crucial role they play within the NFDI ecosystem, how researchers can utilize them, and outlining the goals for 
the current development phase.

DataPLANT already tries to align its services with Base4NFDI to enhance compatibility, scalability, and adoption 
across research domains. Our consortium already collaborates with other consortia and sections within NFDI to 
consolidate efforts and deliver specialized services while ensuring convergence with the broader NFDI vision. 
DataPLANT has actively participated in the "(Meta)data, Terminologies, and Provenance" NFDI section, contributing 
significantly to working groups on "Terminology Services" and "Ontology Harmonization and Mapping." Further, our 
consortium supports key Base4NFDI projects like TS4NFDI, DMP4NFDI, and KGI4NFDI. DataPLANT is committed to 
strengthening its collaboration with TS4NFDI in the second funding period. This includes integrating tools and 
software developed by TS4NFDI with DataPLANT's own developments. Here, we will contribute our ontology-based 
annotation system (SWATE) as a terminology service and adapt the framework for use across other NFDI consortia 
based on feedback. Building on its activities in the NFDI sections, DataPLANT will actively contribute to ontology 
harmonization approaches across all NFDIs. To further enhance its representation and align its developments with 
NFDI goals, DataPLANT will expand its contributions to all working groups within the "(Meta)data, Terminologies, 
and Provenance" section and participate in future Base4NFDI projects related to metadata.
